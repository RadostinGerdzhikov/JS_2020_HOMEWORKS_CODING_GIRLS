3. **(Task \#9)** Write a JavaScript program to find the armstrong numbers of 3 digits. Note: An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, **371** is an Armstrong number since **3\*\*3 + 7\*\*3 + 1\*\*3 = 371**. Search for those numbers from 100 to 999 inclusive.
